      <div id = "predictions">

        <div class="team" id = "champion">
          <header><h3>#1 - Mercedes</h3></header>
          <img class="team_img" src="images/merc.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>Their supremacy has been unquestioned for the better part of a decade, throughout the entire V6-Hybrid era of Formula 1. With Toto Wolff at the helm, they have won the last 8 championships in a row, and, unfortunately for the sport, that will not be ending this year. Their car is the fastest, the most reliable, and they have one of the greatest drivers of all time, Lewis Hamilton, behind the wheel. There is no weakness to exploit, no chink in the armor. Red Bull and others will have to hope for brighter days in the future.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="team" id = "second">
          <header><h3>#2 - Red Bull Racing</h3></header>
          <img class="team_img" src="images/redbull.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>Last year they played second-best behind Mercedes. This year will be no different. Their best hope is to split the two Mercedes cars with Max Verstappen slotting in ahead of Valtteri Bottas in the final Driver’s Standings. It will be a challenge, but one Max showed this year he can meet, as the race between himself and Bottas went down to the final race of the season. Newcomer Sergio Perez is the only X-factor at Red Bull. He will be under immense pressure to out-perform his predecessors in the second seat.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="team" id = "third">
          <header><h3>#3 - McLaren</h3></header>
          <img class="team_img" src="images/mclaren.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>Best of the rest last year, likely best of the rest this year. There are two big changes that McLaren hope will get them over the top to fighting with the big teams ahead of them. The first, is new driver Daniel Ricciardo. Regarded as one of the fastest drivers in the sport, he brings experience, speed, and immense charisma to the team. He could just be what they need to step it up a notch. If not him, though, then it may be their new Power Unit. They spent much of their resources switching from slower, less reliable Renault engine last season, to the best one in the business, Mercedes. They will be faster that is for sure, but will they be fast enough to catch Red Bull?</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="team">
          <header><h3>#4 - Ferrari</h3></header>
          <img class="team_img" src="images/ferrari.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>How the mighty fell last season. The Prancing Horse had a rough go of it last season. Their Power Unit was the slowest of the field. Their car was draggy and unstable in the rear. The legendary Sebastian Vettel struggled mightily to control it over the course of the season. But rising star Charles Leclerc had a much better time of it, often placing it far above where it deserved to be, earning multiple podiums with stunning efforts. Ferrari now place all their hopes in him, replacing Vettel with Carlos Sainz and supposedly bringing upgrades to the PU and chassis that will begin to take them back to their place at the top of F1.</p>

        <div class="team">
          <header><h3>#5 - Aston Martin</h3></header>
          <img class="team_img" src="images/am.png" alt=""/>
          <p>Aston Martin and their iconic British Racing Green is back in F1 after many, many decades. Billionaire Lawrence Stroll has taken up ownership of a moderately successful team in Force India, invested heavily into Aston Martin (the company) and combined his two efforts to create Aston Martin Formula One Team. With Sebastian Vettel coming over from Ferrari and Lance Stroll (Lawrence’s son) making up the driver lineup, fans are expecting big things. The challenge will be great, however, and I expect them to be fighting McLaren and Ferrari week-in and week-out for those precious points.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="team">
          <header><h3>#6 - Alpine</h3></header>
          <img class="team_img" src="images/alpinefull.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>Alpine was dealt a tough blow when star driver Daniel Ricciardo jumped ship for McLaren before the last season even began. Many see it as a vote of no-confidence from one of the sport’s biggest figures. But Alpine were not sitting idle. They picked up none other than Fernando Alonso to replace Ricciardo. Alonso was just about the greatest driver of the 2000’s, winning multiple championships and coming within just a hair of winning even more. There are questions here though, as Alonso is now in his 40’s. Does he still have what it takes to get on the podium? Is Esteban Ocon a strong-enough driver to help drive Alpine up to the top of the midfield? They will definitely be hoping to build on last season’s improvements this year.</p>

        <div class="team">
          <header><h3>#7 - AlphaTauri</h3></header>
          <img class="team_img" src="images/at.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>AlphaTauri saw last season what almost no lower-tier teams have ever seen. A victory in Formula 1. And not just any victory, one in the Italian Grand Prix, at Monza, the “Temple of Speed”. For an Italian team, though owned and administered by Red Bull, the win meant a great deal. Pierre Gasly was the man who delivered it for them, in one of the most memorable moments of the last few years. They’re hoping to repeat the glory this year, retaining Pierre but pairing him with Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda, who has been shooting up the lower Formula ranks the past few years. Though it’s unlikely they have the pace to finish ahead of Alpine, they might just be able to surprise a few people this year, just like they did last year.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="team">
          <header><h3>#8 - Alfa Romeo Racing</h3></header>
          <img class="team_img" src="images/ar.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>Alfa Romeo just might be the least interesting team on the grid this season. They are run fairly well from the top. Their car is not fast, but unlike just about every other team on the grid, there is little drama from year-to-year. For the drivers, they have retained the services of Kimi Raikkonen, who is, as of last year, the most experienced driver in Formula 1 history, having completed almost 20,000 laps in total over hundreds of races in the last 20+ years. Alongside him will be Antonio Giovanazzi, an Italian with long-hair and mediocre results. There is not much to say. Their driver lineup and car are both uninspiring, but not particularly bad. They were 8th in 2018, 8th in 2019, and 8th in 2020. In 2021, they will be 8th. Let’s just move on.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="team">
          <header><h3>#9 - Williams</h3></header>
          <img class="team_img" src="images/williams.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>Williams, Williams, Williams. What was once one of the great powerhouses of Formula 1 has been at the very bottom for quite some time. Last season, they didn’t even score a single point. The year before that, they managed to score one. This year, they find themselves under new management, and they have begun to improve their car. More importantly than that perhaps, is their main driver, George Russell. George is an unquestionable talent. Most people think he could easily be World Champion in a Mercedes. He showed as much at last year’s Sakhir Grand Prix. If anyone can squeeze a point out of their likely pretty terrible car, it’s George. Alongside him will be Nicholas Latifi, who is… ok. Their new owners will look to right the ship over the next few years. I hope that process begins to bear fruit sooner rather than later.</p>

        <div class="team">
          <header><h3>#10 - Haas F1 Team</h3></header>
          <img class="team_img" src="images/haas.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>“America’s Formula 1 Team”, in my mind, is an absolute embarrassment to this country. Last year, they were only faster than Williams, and had, by a wide margin, the worst reliability of any team, with one of their drivers not even finishing 7 out of the 18 races. But that is not the reason why I despise this team. They have sold out to the Mazepins, a family of Russian oligarchs who are, quite frankly, terrible people. Formula 1 rookie and chronic sexual harasser Nikita Mazepin will be driving the newly redesigned Haas car, which has no fewer than 5 Russian flags painted across the side of the car. The only saving grace for the team is their other rookie driver, Mick Schumacher. Son of the legendary Michael Schumacher, he has shown much promise in the lower Formula levels, and fans from every country are eager to see what he can do in his first year in F1.</p>
