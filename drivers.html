              <header><h3>#1 - Lewis Hamilton</h3></header>
              <img class="driver_img" src="images/lewis.jpg" alt=""/>
              <p>Rarely does a sport see such utter domination for so long. Lewis Hamilton has been Champion of the World 7 times in his career, and all signs point to him making that 8 in the upcoming season. Doing so would separate him from Michael Schumacher as the series’s most successful driver of all time. Only Valtteri or Max have the slightest chance at stopping that, but neither have both the equipment and pure skill to make it happen. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver even" id = "second">
                <header><h3>#2 - Valtteri Bottas</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/valtteri.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Valterri Bottas has a hard job, being Lewis Hamilton’s teammate. Last year he was handily beat by Hamilton, and this year looks to be no different. Being in the Mercedes car virtually guarantees a top-3 finish barring disaster, so we’ll look for another good-not-great season from Valtteri.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver odd" id = "third">
                <header><h3>#3 - Max Verstappen</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/max.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Many believe that Max is the most talented driver of the field currently, more so than 7-time champion Lewis Hamilton. What is without debate is that he is just about the only person in the driver lineup with the capability of beating at least one of the Mercedes cars in Valtteri Bottas. Their battle will be one to watch.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver even">
                <header><h3>#4 - Charles Leclerc</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/charles.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Charles Leclerc is already a top-5 driver in F1 despite his young age, and he’s only getting better. Ferrari, the biggest and most storied team in F1, have put all their hopes behind him, pushing 4-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel to the side. Assuming the new Ferrari car has brought along much-needed improvements, look for Leclerc to be fighting for podiums week-in and week-out.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver odd">
                <header><h3>#5 - Daniel Ricciardo</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/daniel.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>The man with the biggest smile in F1 has a new team in McLaren, one he hopes will put him back in contention for race wins for the first time since his Red Bull days. Whether that will happen remains to be seen, but it’s clear that he chose a good team in McLaren, who have been sharply upwards the past 3 or 4 years. Last year he showed off his skill bringing a 5th place Renault car onto the podium multiple times. Let’s hope that keeps happening this year.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver even">
                <header><h3>#6 - Sergio Perez</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/sergio.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Sergio Perez made his mark in F1 more than ever, with a 4th place finish in the driver standings and his maiden F1 win. And what a win it was, with Sergio being spun out through no fault of his own during the first lap, being relegated to last place, before fighting back through the entire field to secure victory. Wow. He now finds himself in a better car than last year, so more of those performances might very well be on the way from the Mexian driver. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver odd">
                <header><h3>#7 - Sebastian Vettel</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/sebastian.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>This time last year, 4-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel was rather unceremoniously informed by Ferrari that they weren’t interested in renewing his contract, presumably because they wanted to put their efforts behind the young and supremely talented Charles Leclerc. Now, he finds a new home in Aston Martin, who will need his experience to continue the development of their car, which was just about the 3rd fastest car last season.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver even">
                <header><h3>#8 - Lando Norris</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/lando.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Lando is young and quick, with a killer sense of humor. Last year, he showed many flashes of pure speed, but lost out to teammate Carlos Sainz due to lower overall consistency. He has a new teammate now in Daniel Ricciardo, one that might be even faster than his last one. Keeping up with him will be a challenge, but he has much more experience with the car and the team, giving him some degree of advantage. He has built up some job security over the last couple of years, but beating Ricciardo means his seat would be safe for quite a while.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver odd">
                <header><h3>#9 - Carlos Sainz</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/carlos.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Carlos Sainz, son of the legendary rally driver of the same name now finds himself with one of the most prestigious drives in all of F1, that of Ferrari. He is fast, but most drivers who have made the step up to the Prancing Horse have achieved more in their careers than just a couple of podiums. He’ll slot in as the #2 driver behind Charles Leclerc, where he’ll look to have a presence at the front of the grid with what is usually a bullet of a car.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver even">
                <header><h3>#10 - Lance Stroll</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/lance.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Lance Stroll initially won his seat in F1 through his father, Lawrence Stroll, investing heavily into Williams. Since then, Lance has proven himself to be a capable driver in his own right. Though he is still under his father’s financial wing at Aston Martin, he would likely be able to secure his own seat without that level of support. Now, though, he looks to support his team by playing a #2 role behind veteran superstar Sebastian Vettel under the recently re-imagined Aston Martin name.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver odd">
                <header><h3>#11 - Fernando Alonso</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/fernando.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>The King of Spain has returned. Alonso, a two-time World Champion (2007, 2008) is back in F1 with the team he won his Championships with, after a short retirement. He is now one of the oldest drivers of the last few decades, coming in at 41 at the start of the season. We know his skill, but does he still have what it takes to compete at such a high level?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver even">
                <header><h3>#12 - Pierre Gasly</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/pierre.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Gasly provided F1 fans with one of the most exciting races of the past 20 years last year at the Italian Grand Prix. A chaotic race from start to finish saw Gasly take a shock win after an incredibly dramatic final few laps. It was the first time that a team not in the top-3 had taken a win since 2008. The win was very well-deserved, after a very hard couple of years for the young Frenchman. He’ll be looking to build on them this year with some more strong results. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver odd">
                <header><h3>#13 - Esteban Ocon</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/esteban.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Esteban Ocon heavily underperformed last season at Renault compared to teammate Daniel Ricciardo. Much can be forgiven though, as it was his first year back after a one-season break. Now, in his second season with the team, he will look to beat an aging Fernando Alonso. Not managing to beat someone well past his prime like Alonso would be a big hit to his young career.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver even">
                <header><h3>#14 - Yuki Tsunoda</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/yuki.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>The first of Formula 1’s three rookies this season, Yuki Tsunoda is coming into the sport with great expectations. He has risen through the lower Formula ranks extremely quickly. He has shown great talent, but Alpha Tauri and Red Bull will hopefully not push him too hard in his first season, as they have done with Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon in the past, to each of their detriments. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver odd">
                <header><h3>#15 - Kimi Raikkonen</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/kimi.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Formula 1 is just a hobby for Kimi Raikkonen, as he famously stated in Netflix’s show “Drive to Survive.” Well, he’s back again at Alfa Romeo to continue his little hobby. As with every season the last few years, this one could very well be the last for the most experienced racer in F1 history. He has hundreds of GP’s and almost 20,000 laps under his belt. And if he keeps beating his teammate, why not stick around a little longer?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver even">
                <header><h3>#16 - Antonio Giovanazzi</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/antonio.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>That teammate in question is Antonio Giovanazzi. How he manages to keep his seat is a mystery to all. But, as the most handsome driver on the grid (don’t @ me Leclerc fans) and the only Italian in F1, he comes with significant marketing power for italian car-makers Alfa Romeo and Ferrari. This year though may be his last, as there are multiple up-and-comers knocking at the door for a seat.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver odd">
                <header><h3>#17 - George Russell</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/george.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>F1 is not a fair sport. George Russell knows that better than most. He clearly is one of the most talented drivers in F1. But, he has been stuck for multiple years in what has been, by a very very wide margin, the slowest car in F1. If he had a top-car, he would be fighting for race wins every week. He showed as much at the Sakhir Grand Prix, where he controlled the race in an utter masterclass, until multiple disasters outside of his control lost him the race. He is hoping that Mercedes pass on Bottas sooner rather than later, or that Lewis retires, to get him the golden seat of F1. When that happens, expect domination from the young Brit.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver even">
                <header><h3>#18 - Mick Schumacher</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/mick.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Mick Schumacher is the son of the legendary Michael Schumacher, 7-time World Champion of the sport and the most successful in its history until Lewis Hamilton came along. Mick is talented, but has a big name to live up to. He has been able to manage it so far in the lower Formulas, but F1 is a different beast. Unfortunately, his journey in the sport will start at the most poorly run team, Haas. Hopefully, he does well enough to get a ticket out to a better team as soon as possible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver odd">
                <header><h3>#19 - Nicholas Latifi</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/nicholas.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Latifi was F1’s only rookie last season. He came in 20th out of 20 just about every week as he was in the slowest car by a wide margin and going up against a beast in George Russell. The money he has brought Williams via sponsorship deals has helped the team stay afloat in tough times, but now that they have new management and investments in the form of Dorilton Capital, he will have to show more on track to keep his seat. A good place to start would be beating Mazepin at Haas.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="driver even">
                <header><h3>#20 - Nikita Mazepin</h3></header>
                <img class="driver_img" src="images/nikita.jpg" alt=""/>
                <p>Now we get to Nikita Mazepin. I don’t even know where to start, what to say. I’ll be blunt then: Mazepin’s presence in F1 is a black mark on the entire sport. For those out of the loop, he is a danger to other drivers on the track by deliberately crashing into them. Off the track he is even more violent. He has in the past attacked and sucker-punched drivers due to a perceived slight. That’s not even the worst part. This winter he posted videos of himself sexually harrassing and groping a young woman. Despite all that, he remains in F1 due to immense wealth his family has built through exploitation and corruption in the Russian mining business. The sooner he and his father are out of the sport and behind bars, the better.</p>
