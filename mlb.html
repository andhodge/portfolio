      <p>All done with the Formula 1 predictions! Now time for the America's pastime: Major League Baseball!</p>

      <div id = "divisions">
        <div class="division" id = "aleast">
          <header><h3>American League East: New York Yankees</h3></header>
          <img class="div_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <img class="team_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <p>The AL East continues the perennial juggernaut New York Yankees, who will in all likelihood take the division this year. They will face a stiffer challenge than usual, however. The Toronto Blue Jays have a very young, talented core, and have spent the past couple of free-agencies building on to that with big-name signings. Elsewhere, the Rays, despite losing many of their best players, are still by-and-large the same team that made it to the World Series this past season. This division is to the one to watch in the AL.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="division" id = "alcentral">
          <header><h3>American League Central: Minnesota Twins</h3></header>
          <img class="div_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <img class="team_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <p>I think the AL Central will be a two-horse race this season, between the Twins and the White Sox. Minnesota has an explosive one-two punch in the form of Josh Donaldson and Nelson Cruz, with solid pitching to boot. On the South Side of Chicago, the White Sox have a deeper lineup that is missing a star to pair with reigning AL MVP Jose Abreu. Their pitching is good too, slightly more top heavy than the Twins with Lucas Giolito leading the way. This is, overall, a weak division, but the race between the Twins and White Sox will be interesting, with the Twins probably narrowly winning out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="division" id = "alwest">
          <header><h3>American League West: Houston Astros</h3></header>
          <img class="div_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <img class="team_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <p>The AL West will likely be taken by the Astros, as much as I hate to admit it. They haven’t been the same team since their infamous sign-stealing scandal shook the sport and people’s faith in its integrity. But, they are still hyper-talented, with the best lineup in the division by a wide margin. That’s despite the fact that the Angels have one of the greatest players of all time in his prime, Mike Trout. It won’t be enough to beat the Astros, unfortunately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="division" id = "nleast">
          <header><h3>National League East: Atlanta Braves</h3></header>
          <img class="div_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <img class="team_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <p>This will probably be the toughest division in baseball this season. The Nationals are two years off of a World Series now. The Marlins are young and talented. The Phillies are a .500 team. But the stars of the show are the Mets and Braves. The Mets are very talented and much-improved, while the Braves have the second-best young core in baseball, many of whom are locked into team-friendly long-term contracts. The Braves will take this division.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="division" id = "nlcentral">
          <header><h3>National League Central: Milwaukee Brewers</h3></header>
          <img class="div_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <img class="team_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <p>Again, the Central is the weakest division in its League. There just aren’t any teams that stand out in any meaningful way. I guess the Brewers will take it? Mostly off of MVP-candidate Yelich’s hitting most likely. The Cubs will likely be close behind, but they're just an average team as well. Whoever it is in the end will likely be dispatched by the Braves in the first round anyways.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="division" id = "nlwest">
          <header><h3>National League West: Los Angeles Dodgers</h3></header>
          <img class="div_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <img class="team_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <p>It’s not common for one division to have two of the top 3 teams in all of baseball, maybe even the best two. This division will be an absolute slugfest between the Dodgers and the Padres. Unfortunately for San Diego, though, the Dodgers are very clearly the best team in baseball and will likely take the division with a few games of cushion, allowing them to rest their stars before most likely facing the Padres in the first round.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id = "pennants">
        <div class="pennant" id = "al">
          <header><h3>American League: New York Yankees</h3></header>
          <img class="league_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <img class="team_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <p>The New York Yankees are the best team in the AL when everything goes right. And by right, I mean when their players actually take the field. They have been plagued by injury problems for the last few years, but have been able to make solid seasons out of them despite all of that. This postseason, I expect them to pull it all together to make a deep run to the World Series.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pennant" id = "nl">
          <header><h3>National League: Los Angeles Dodgers</h3></header>
          <img class="league_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <img class="team_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <p>The Dodgers could carry themselves through the NLDS and NLCS on just their pitching staff alone. Or, they could carry themselves through to the World Series on just their lineup alone. They have no weakness, no vulnerability to exploit. They have 3 Cy Young candidates on the mound with loads of young talent behind them. They have 2 MVP candidates just in their outfield, not to mention one of the best catchers and shortstops. They will be here late in October.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id = "ws">
        <div id="ws_team">
          <header><h3>World Series: Los Angeles Dodgers</h3></header>
          <img class="ws_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <img class="team_logo" src="" alt="" />
          <p>As you probably already read, multiple times, the Dodgers are the best team in baseball. And, as far as we can tell now, it isn’t even really that close. Last season, they won an absurd amount of games, stormed their way through the playoffs and won the World Series. There were some struggles against the Braves on the way, however, but none they couldn’t overcome. This will be the same this year. There may be some moments here and there where they struggle, potentially against the Padres, Yankees, or Braves, but they will beat them all and be crowned World Series Champions for the second season in a row.</p>
